**About the author:**

My name is Pavlos Anastasiadis. I recently graduated from Lancaster University with a Computer Science Bachelor's and Masters' in Information Technology Management and Organisational Change (ITMOC for short).Other than the emerging technologies and their effects on organisation, I am passionate about [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/pav.anastasiadis/), design in perspective to human-computer interactions, cooking and aerobic based exercises (cycling, running and skiing).

**About the page:**

This is a static website that was built on the source code provided by [Basically Basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) and hosted by [**GitHub** Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This page mainly serves as an online CV but also as a creative outlet. In the words of my great friend [Alex](https://twitter.com/nderjung) "Every tech guy needs to have a webpage.Make one!"
